# Swift doesn't use oslo policy RBAC, so it's different from other services.
# For enabling SRBAC for Swift we have to add a template file with the
# following content instead of using enable-secure-rbac.yaml file, mimicking
# the same but without setting EnforceSecureRbac.
# This would be an intermediate workaround for now, until a permanent fix is proposed.
